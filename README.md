# React + Tailwind CSS + Fastify - README

## Introduction

Welcome to our Boilerplate Project! This project is designed as a starter kit for building fast and efficient web applications using JavaScript as both a frontend and backend.

## Project Structure

This boilerplate contains the following key components:

- **Vite**: A modern and fast build tool for JavaScript projects.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Fastify**: A lightweight and modern backend http framework

**frontend** Contains the vite + React template, which can be started using `npm start` command
